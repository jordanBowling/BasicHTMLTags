    <h1>Seriously, follow me on twitch!</h1>
    <h4>I know I am being annoying \_(^_^)_/</h4>
    <p>I never stream anymore, but I do enjoy doing it. Maybe, a couple more followers will give me the energy to hang up my LED lights in my new house. 
    I never hung them up or started streaming again when I moved. Are you gonna be the follower that gets me back into it?</p>
    
    <p>Below is a list of reasons why you should join my twitch community:</p>
    <ol>
    <dl>
        <li>
            <dt>
            <b>We love everyone in my house.</b>
            </dt>
        </li>
        <dd>There is no hate on my stream. Jerks get that big 'ol BAN HAMMER!</dd>
<br />
        <li>
            <dt>
            <b>You are actually better than me at video games</b>
            </dt>
        </li>
        <dd>Hey. I am not that good, but you can learn from my mistakes!</dd>
<br />
        <li>
            <dt>
            <b>I do have some pretty cool graphics</b>
            </dt>
        </li>
        <dd>Do you like cool images and screen transitions? Ok. Well I only have a few right now, but if you come I will make more just for you.</dd>
    </dl>
    </ol>

    <p>If you are still not convinced, then maybe you should check out my <a href="https://www.artstation.com/jordanbowling" target="_blank">ArtStation</a> page that only has my attempts at VFX on it. 
    There is some stuff from a project I worked on for NASA though.</p>

    <p>Now that I know I have you just itching to follow me on twitch, go ahead and click the image below to open a new tab to my twitch. I'll see you there.</p>
